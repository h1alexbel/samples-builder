wasp-lang/wasp,"The fastest way to develop full-stack web apps with React & Node.js. Web page | Docs Wasp ( W eb A pplication Sp ecification) is a Rails-like framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma.
Build your app in a day and deploy it with a single CLI command! Why is Wasp awesome 🚀 Quick start : Due to its expressiveness, you can create and deploy a production-ready web app from scratch with very few lines of concise, consistent, declarative code. 😌 No boilerplate : By abstracting away complex full-stack features, there is less boilerplate code. That means less code to maintain and understand! It also means easier upgrades. 🔓 No lock-in : You can deploy the Wasp app anywhere you like. There is no lock-in into specific providers; you have full control over the code (and can actually check it out in .wasp/ dir if you are interested ). Features 🔒 Full-stack Auth, 🖇️ RPC (Client <-> Server), 🚀 Simple Deployment, ⚙ ️Jobs, ✉️ Email Sending, 🛟 Full-stack Type Safety, ... Code example Simple Wasp config file in which you describe the high-level details of your web app:
```js
// file: main.wasp app todoApp {
  title: ""ToDo App"",  // visible in the browser tab
  wasp: { version: ""^0.13.0"" },
  auth: { // full-stack auth out-of-the-box
    userEntity: User, methods: { email: {...} }
  }
} route RootRoute { path: ""/"", to: MainPage }
page MainPage {
  authRequired: true, // Limit access to logged-in users.
  component: import Main from ""@client/Main.tsx"" // Your React code.
} query getTasks {
  fn: import { getTasks } from ""@server/tasks.js"", // Your Node.js code.
  entities: [Task] // Automatic cache invalidation.
} entity Task {=psl  // Your Prisma data model.
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    description String
    isDone      Boolean @default(false)
psl=}
``` The rest of the code you write in React / Node.js / Prisma and just reference it from the .wasp file. :arrow_forward: Check out TodoApp example for the complete code example. :arrow_backward: How it works Given a simple .wasp configuration file that describes the high-level details of your web app, and .js(x)/.css/..., source files with your unique logic, Wasp compiler generates the full source of your web app in the target stack: front-end, back-end and deployment. This unique approach is what makes Wasp ""smart"" and gives it its superpowers! For more information about Wasp, check docs . Get started Run curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh to install Wasp on OSX/Linux/WSL(Win). From there, just follow the instructions to run your first app in less than a minute! For more details, check out the docs . Wasp AI / Mage Wasp comes with experimental AI code generator to help you kickstart your next Wasp project -> you can use it via wasp new in the CLI (choose ""AI"" option) if you can provide your OpenAI keys or you can do it via our Mage web app in which case our OpenAI keys are used in the background. This repository This is the main repo of the Wasp universe, containing core code (mostly waspc - Wasp compiler) and the supporting materials. Project status Currently, Wasp is in beta, with most features flushed out and working well.
However, there are still a lot of improvements and additions that we have in mind for the future, and we are working on them constantly, so you can expect a lot of changes and improvements in the future. While the idea is to support multiple web tech stacks in the future, right now, we are focusing on the specific stack: React + react-query, NodeJS + ExpressJS, and Prisma. Contributing Any way you want to contribute is a good way :)! The best place to start is to check out waspc/ , where you can find detailed steps for first-time contributors + technical details about the Wasp compiler. The core of Wasp is built in Haskell, but there are also a lot of non-Haskell parts of Wasp, so you will certainly be able to find something for you! Even if you don't plan to submit any code, just joining the discussion on discord and giving your feedback is already great and helps a lot (motivates us and helps us figure out how to shape Wasp)!
